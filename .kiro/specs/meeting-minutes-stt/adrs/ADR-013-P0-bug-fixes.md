# ADR-013 P0 Bug Fixes

**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: Completed
**Related**: ADR-013 Sidecar Full-Duplex IPC Final Design

## Context

After initial ADR-013 implementation (Phase 1-4), external code review identified two critical P0 bugs that violated core design contracts:

1. **P0-2**: Ring buffer partial write corruption (0% frame loss contract violation)
2. **P0-1**: VAD state check AttributeError (potential crash)

These bugs were discovered through rigorous code review before production deployment.

## P0-2: Ring Buffer Partial Write Prevention

### Problem

**File**: `src-tauri/src/ring_buffer.rs:104-122`

Original implementation allowed partial writes when buffer was nearly full:

```rust
pub fn push_from_callback(
    producer: &mut ringbuf::HeapProd<u8>,
    data: &[u8],
) -> (usize, BufferLevel) {
    // Try to push all data
    let pushed = producer.push_slice(data);  // ← Allows partial writes

    // Check AFTER write (too late!)
    if pushed < data.len() {
        return (pushed, BufferLevel::Overflow);  // ← Frame already corrupted
    }
    // ...
}
```

**Impact**:
- When buffer is 95% full, 320-byte frame might only write 100 bytes
- Remaining 220 bytes are **silently discarded**
- This violates ADR-013's "0% frame loss" contract
- Corrupted frames cause audio artifacts and transcription errors

### Solution

Check free space **before** writing to prevent partial writes:

```rust
pub fn push_from_callback(
    producer: &mut ringbuf::HeapProd<u8>,
    data: &[u8],
) -> (usize, BufferLevel) {
    // CRITICAL: Check free space BEFORE writing
    if producer.vacant_len() < data.len() {
        // Reject entire frame (no partial write)
        return (0, BufferLevel::Overflow);
    }

    // Now we know entire frame fits
    let pushed = producer.push_slice(data);
    debug_assert_eq!(pushed, data.len(), "Partial write should never occur");
    // ...
}
```

**Verification**:
- All 11 ring buffer unit tests pass
- 4/4 E2E tests pass (including `test_60s_continuous_speech_zero_frame_loss`)
- `debug_assert_eq!` ensures partial writes never occur in debug builds

## P0-1: VAD State Check AttributeError

### Problem

**File**: `python-stt/stt_engine/audio_pipeline.py:424-425`

Original implementation referenced non-existent fields:

```python
def is_in_speech(self) -> bool:
    # Check if VAD is in speech state
    return self.vad.silence_duration == 0 and self.vad.speech_active
    #          ^^^ AttributeError         ^^^ AttributeError
```

**Root Cause**:
- `VoiceActivityDetector` class (L53-56) exposes: `is_in_speech`, `speech_frames`, `silence_frames`
- Referenced fields `silence_duration` and `speech_active` do not exist
- Would cause `AttributeError` crash when `pipeline.is_in_speech()` is called

**Impact**:
- Potential Python sidecar crash during silence detection
- No graceful degradation (immediate crash)
- Not caught by E2E tests (code path not exercised)

### Solution

Use actual `VoiceActivityDetector` field:

```python
def is_in_speech(self) -> bool:
    # Check if VAD is in speech state using actual field
    return self.vad.is_in_speech
```

**Verification**:
- Static analysis confirms `VoiceActivityDetector.is_in_speech` exists (L53)
- Field is updated by `process_frame()` method (L152, L177)
- Semantically equivalent to original intent (currently detecting speech)

## Test Results

### Before Fix
- **Risk**: Partial writes allowed, AttributeError on silence detection
- **Frame Loss**: Potential corruption on buffer near-full conditions

### After Fix
- **Ring Buffer Tests**: 11/11 passed ✅
- **E2E Tests**: 4/4 passed (72s total) ✅
  - Test 1: 5s Python hang → buffer overflow (6.0s)
  - Test 2: 60s continuous → 0% frame loss (6000 frames)
  - Test 3: VAD active → 0 false no_speech (1000 frames)
  - Test 4: Parallel execution → no deadlock (500 frames)

## Decision

✅ **Accept both fixes** — Critical bugs that violate ADR-013 contracts.

### Rationale

1. **P0-2** (Partial write):
   - Directly violates "0% frame loss" Success Criteria
   - Simple fix with clear semantics (check before write)
   - No performance impact (single branch check)

2. **P0-1** (AttributeError):
   - Latent crash bug (not yet triggered in tests)
   - One-line fix using correct field
   - No semantic change (same intent)

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ 0% frame loss guarantee maintained
- ✅ Crash risk eliminated
- ✅ All Success Criteria met
- ✅ No performance regression

### Negative
- ⚠️ E2E tests did not catch P0-1 (silence detection path not covered)
- ⚠️ Code review was essential for finding these bugs

## Action Items

1. ✅ Apply P0-2 fix (ring buffer)
2. ✅ Apply P0-1 fix (VAD state)
3. ✅ Verify all tests pass
4. ⏳ Consider adding E2E test for silence detection path (future work)
5. ⏳ Update Requirement Traceability Matrix
